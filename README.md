# SWAPI APP

This repo contains the very basic Star Wars API Explorer Project. Hope you'll like it :)

## Prerequisites

In order to run this project locally, Docker (18.06.0+) & docker-compose have to be installed on your machine.
You also have to create an `.env` file and populate it with appropriate values.

> `$ cp .env.example .env`

At this point you can build and run the whole stack with:

> `$ docker-compose up --build`

The initial build might take a while, but once all containers are up head to http://localhost:8000/collections and have a look around :)
